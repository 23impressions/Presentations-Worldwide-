= Rails Summit 2009: Real-time Ruby for the Real-time Web

The real-time web is an idea, a set of protocols and an architectural overhaul. In this talk we will examine the underlying technologies, look at their Ruby interfaces and relate them to real-life use cases. We will start at the protocol level with XMPP and AMQP, compare their features and benefits, and will then examine the new and ‘lightweight’ options embodied in WebHooks, PubSubHubbub, and long-polling. No prior knowledge of these technologies will be required. We will start from the ground up, examine the protocols, discuss the implied architecture and finally map them into Ruby & Ruby on Rails implementations.
